Helping users launch their new WordPress site in just a few clicks.

== Description ==

The WP Easy Mode plugin is designed to help users (especially those new to WordPress) get their site up and running in just a few easy steps.

By default, these steps are:

1. Start - Are you new to WordPress or a seasoned pro?
2. Settings - Set basic options like the site title and tagline.
3. Theme - Browse through the top free themes from WordPress.org.

Bonus: Behind the scenes, WP Easy Mode will use GeoIP detection to automatically set the Timezone String and Start of Week settings in WordPress. We call them "Smart Defaults".

Development of this community plugin is maintained by [GoDaddy](https://www.godaddy.com) on [GitHub](https://github.com).
